# Node.js and Express API for Managing Books

This is a Node.js and Express API for managing book data. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books. The API is based on the following data schema:

## Data Schema

- `title` (String, required, unique): The title of the book.
- `summary` (String, required): A summary or description of the book.
- `price` (Number, required): The price of the book.
- `author` (String, required): The name of the author.
- `isDeleted` (Boolean, default: false): A flag indicating whether the book is deleted.
- `releasedAt` (Date, required): The date when the book was released.
- `deletedAt` (Date): The date when the book was deleted (if applicable).

The schema also includes automatic timestamps for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /book`: Create a new book.
- `GET /books`: Get a list of all books.
- `GET /books/:id`: Get a specific book by its ID.
- `PUT /books/:id`: Update a book by its ID.
- `DELETE /books/:id`: Delete a book by its ID.
